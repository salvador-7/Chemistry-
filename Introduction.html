<H1><b> PH Scale </b></H1>

<br>
<P><font size="5"> 
 The PH scale measures how acidic an object is. Objects that are
 not very acidic are called basic. The scale has values ranging from
 zero (the most acidic)   to 14 (the most basic). The measurement was
 originally used by the Danish biochemist Sørensen to represent
 the hydrogen ion concentration, expressed in equivalents per litre, 
 of an aqueous solution.
 
 <P> The pH is usually measured with a pH meter, which translates into pH readings the 
difference in electromotive 
force (electrical potential or voltage) between suitable electrodes placed in the 
solution to be tested. Fundamentally, a pH meter consists of a voltmeter attached 
to a pH-responsive electrode and a reference (unvarying) electrode. The pH-responsive 
electrode is usually glass, and the reference is usually a mercury-mercurous chloride 
(calomel) electrode, although a silver-silver chloride electrode is sometimes used.
 When the two electrodes are immersed in a solution, they act as a battery. The glass
 electrode develops an electric potential (charge) that is directly related to the
 hydrogen-ion activity in the solution, and the voltmeter measures the potential difference 
between the glass and reference electrodes. </P>
 
<P>The meter may have either a digital or an analog 
(scale and deflected needle) readout. Digital readouts have the advantage of exactness, while 
analog readouts give better indications of rates of change. Battery-powered portable pH meters
 are widely used for field tests of the pH of soils. Tests of pH may also be performed, less 
accurately, with litmus paper or by mixing indicator dyes in liquid suspensions and matching 
the resulting colours against a colour chart calibrated in pH.In agriculture, the pH is probably 
the most important single property of the moisture associated with a soil, since that indication
 reveals what crops will grow readily in the soil and what adjustments must be made to adapt it 
for growing any other crops. Acidic soils are often considered infertile, and so they are for most 
conventional agricultural crops, although conifers and many members of the family Ericaceae, such 
as blueberries, will not thrive in alkaline soil. Acidic soil can be “sweetened,” or neutralized,
 by treating it with lime. </P>

<H1> Hypothesis </H1>

<P>If different substances are added to a solution, 
then the pH level of the solution will change depending 
on whether the added substance is an acid or a base.
